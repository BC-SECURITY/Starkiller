# Contributing to Starkiller

We appreciate your input! Our goal is to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether you're:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Creating GitHub Issues

Before submitting, please review the existing Starkiller issues to check if the error has been resolved in the development branch or if we decided not to fix it for any reason.

The more information you provide in a GitHub issue, the easier it will be for us to track down and resolve the problem:

- Specify the version of Empire you're using.
- Provide the OS and Starkiller version you're using.
- Describe the expected behavior and the error you encountered.
- The more detail, the better!
- Include any actions you took just before the error occurred.
- Post a screenshot of the error, a link to a Pastebin dump, or embed the error text.
- Any additional relevant information.

## Making a Pull Request

Start by creating an issue to describe the motivation behind your changes.

Pull requests without associated issues may still be accepted if the motivation is obvious. However, linking to an issue can help speed up code review if thereâ€™s any uncertainty.  
- Fork the repo and create your branch from the `main` branch.  
- Ensure your code lints correctly.  
- Submit that pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We follow Airbnb's and Vue's recommended ESLint configurations. To make your life easier, consider installing an ESLint plugin in your preferred editor. You can also run `yarn lint`.
